# Dex contracts

In order to launch the dex contracts, you will need to have docker installed an run the following commands:

```sh
# compile contracts
cd dex # move to dex folder
chmod +x compile.sh
./compile.sh
cd .. # go back to this folder

# start docker sandbox
docker compose up -d 

# wait a couple minutes for sandbox to start

# test
pytest

# stop docker sandbox
docker compose down
```

# Originate the contract
As you can see, there are four directories inside. 
- **config**: required configuration in order to originate the contract
- **michelson-json**: smart contract and its storage in michelson json
- **origination**: script that originates the smart-contract
- **smartpy**: smart-contract in smartpy

While doing the operations, be sure to be in the `contract` directory.
